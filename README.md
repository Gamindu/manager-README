# Hi, I'm Molly

I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and this document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## My role as a tech lead
TL;DR: I am here to make sure our team is successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to improve our product and our business. More granularly:

1. I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our company's and our team's mission.
2. I am here to make sure our team is successful and pointed in the right direction. You might hear @dharmeshs talking about [aligning vectors](https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3): I am here to make sure our team is all aligned and pushing in the same direction.\*
3. I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us.
4. I write some code too :smiley:

These are in approximate order of importance. If you are not successful and happy, our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, writing code will most likely not be my top priority.

Additionally: My job is *not* to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. It is also not to be the "official decision maker" for our team.

## Feedback
If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I *do* want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love feedback on why you feel that way!

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

## Work–life balance
I strongly believe in a healthy work–life balance. This can mean a lot of things: coming into the office a little late because you're a zombie before 10am (guilty...), leaving by 5pm so you can pick your kids up from daycare, not being on call some days because of your religion, taking time off to maintain your health, etc.

Let me know if you need any help to make this work. I don't want you working ridiculous hours, and I don't want you working at the expense of your family/health/beliefs/etc.

## If you need something
Some weeks, my schedule can be pretty full. Other weeks it's not so bad. If you need to chat, you have a few options.

1. Snag me at my desk. An important thing to know about me: if I have headphones on, it does *not* mean I am "in the zone" or expect not to be interrupted. I'm probably just enjoying some music! Feel free to grab my attention (preferably by waving in my periphery or tapping my desk—I get a little startled sometimes if someone unexpectedly taps me :neutral_face:) If I'm about to have to run off for a meeting or somesuch, I'll let you know and figure out a better time to chat.
2. Slack me or email me. Even if you want an in-person meeting, just message me to let me know you want to talk and I'll make time. If you would rather talk about something over email or message, that's fine too.
3. Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or a businessy meeting and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule. If you see that I've blocked off the day as a "meeting-free day", that does not apply to you—it's more to discourage folks from scheduling non-urgent meetings that day that could be scheduled otherwise. If you need to talk, schedule over this as much as you need.

## Caveat
Take this document with a grain of salt: I wrote it! I have never experienced having me as a manager. If I'm your TL and something here seems off, open a pull request or issue, or (probably more comfortably) bring it up to me in one-on-one or over Slack.

## Notes

\* I thought I'd manage to write this document to be HubSpot-agnostic and I've failed in line 6...
